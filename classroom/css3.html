        Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling.
        The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends, Hermione
        Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends
        to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and
         subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).

        In the sixth book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Snape teaches Defence Against the
         Dark Arts while Horace Slughorn becomes the Potions master. Harry finds an old textbook with
        annotations by the Half-Blood Prince, due to which he achieves success in Potions class.
        Harry also takes lessons with Dumbledore, viewing memories about the early life of Voldemort in
        a device called a Pensieve. Harry learns from a drunken Slughorn that he used to teach Tom Riddle,
        and that Voldemort divided his soul into pieces, creating a series of Horcruxes. Harry and 
        Dumbledore travel to a distant lake to destroy a Horcrux; they succeed, but Dumbledore weakens.
        On their return, they find Draco Malfoy and Death Eaters attacking the school. The book ends with
         the killing of Dumbledore by Professor Snape, the titular Half-Blood Prince.
